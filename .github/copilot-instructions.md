# Copilot Instructions for personal-wiki

Markdown-only personal knowledge base, served via GitHub Pages (Jekyll + `just-the-docs`).

## First Step — Always

Read `AGENT.md` before any edit. It is the **single source of truth** for structure, entry format, ordering rules, and categories.

## Agent-Specific Rules

- **Always fetch URLs** before writing descriptions — accuracy over guessing.
- When the user asks to add a resource and the category is ambiguous, **ask** rather than guess.
- For preference-ordered sections (Blogs, Videos, Youtube channels), **ask the user** where to insert — don't just append.
- `awesome/*.md` files have their own format (tables, `🆓` prefix for FOSS) — don't apply `README.md` entry format there.
- Update `skills/README.md` when new agent capabilities are added.
- Don't change `_config.yml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `AGENT.md` unless explicitly asked.
