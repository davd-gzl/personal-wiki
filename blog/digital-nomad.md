# How to be digital nomad

// WHOAMI
I'm a French developper, specialised in education content, P2P and highly interested in Open Source.
I started travelling as a regular basis after my study in 2025. I want to document the world.
I like to share my knowledges to help peers.


- What is digital nomad
// definition of nomad
Single nomad : Be alone, not lonely
Group nomad : Save all together (for longer period)

//// Goal: Seeking FREEDOM 

- My Gears (backpack, laptop, camera (risk in the world), single backpack, camera)
// Backpack
Your bag should be:
- Big enough (~20/30L), no needs for giant backpack if you stay in city
- Rolltop bag with a laptop entrance -- Rain resistant, can be bigger on demand
- Can easily go from MOVING (everything inside) <-> WORKING (laptop only)
- Resistant (I wish to never have a broken zip in random country)

Reference:
- THULE - Amazing quality built, efficient, cheap, European
- PRVKE - State of the art for camera bag
- AER - American, more expensive, very good quality

// Utilities
2 clothes bag (one for clean, one for used)
7 days of clothes
2 pants
1 short
1 close-skin clothes (for low temperature)
1 wash bag (toothbrush, ...)

3 small utilities bags: 
- 1 for technical (chargers, transformer (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, ...))
- 1 for everyday (rope for wet clothes)
- 1 for else (e.g.: coins)

1 coins bag - Essential in some country, like Japan where having too many coins is usual
1 sleeping bag (optional)

// Tech
- 2 phones /!\ - If one break, you are basically on your own
- Anker battery - Game changer for recharging laptop, phone, recharge fast at any place, can recharge 16 inch laptop
- 2 USB-C chargers
- Transformers (Europe <-> Japan, USA, ...)

// Camera
- Action camera (DJI, GoPro) - Useful to vlog your life from your pocket with good quality

// Wallet,
- 2/3 credits cards from different bank - If one is locked, you are on your own
- Copy of your essential paper (passport, ID card, visa)

// Carry-on luggage
I do not recommend having one, it is:
- Big: Wherever you go, you have to move it (Especially staircase good luck)
- Have to pay in local plane (In europe especially - RyanAir, easyjet, ...)
Though it can be necessary if you need to have a lot of tech, if you are video maker, ..., but it will make moving harder.

- Where to buy?
If you are in Asia, there are giant utilities stores like Daiso in South Korea / Japan, ...
If you are in Europe, AliExpress (Very cheap, though bit random sometimes), Amazon (But generally overpriced), or in capital there are some specialised store (e.g.: Le petit campeur in Paris)
In other continent I have no idea

There's two mindset:
- Big laptop, comfortable all running in local
- Small laptop / tablet, easily remplacable (broken, stolen, ...), all working in SSH
I've met developers having server running on demand at home controlled by SSH using TMUX on tablet.
With agentic mode, you can entirely control your flow only using a phone / tablet (e.g.: opencode on native debian VM on Android + local transcription using whisper)

All offline mindset:
You wont always be connected, so you should be independant and protected, especially in dangerous location.
-> E-INK phone as a knowledge base
I'm still developping it, but the idea is:
- One phone, never connected, with almost unlimited battery (1 month/+)
- Can be recharge with sun / accessible energy
- Can be use for podcast listening, wikivoyage / wikipedia
- Local AI (can consume a lot of battery)
- Transcription
- P2P communication (Briar, Berty) for group mailing (e.g.: 1 phone always recharging act as a server (needs password to interact), others act as messenger) -- This is limited and should only be used in very limited area (e.g.: Remote village, war teritory (i wish not)) /!\


- Jobs in informatics to be digital nomad (as I'm in informatics)
The easy way is free-lance, or full-remote company.
A junior salary in free-lance in France can start slow at ~150/200€/day, while you can easily go over 300/400€/day when more experienced, which is over +2000€ a month for 2 days a week (which is enough in Asia for example)

Find one client, work hard, get trust, and either:
- Be stable, move relatively little (once every ~1/3 week) - 3/5 days a week of work
- Move a lot (once every ~2/3 days) - 1/2 days a week

- How much it cost (realistically)
If you live in a high GDP country, travelling will cost less then staying home.
As a French, being in spain cost me equivalently then staying in Lyon (Travelling + hotel included).
Being in South Korea, living cost me twice less then staying in Lyon.
In long term, if you have a remote job, you will save more **while** travelling on budget.
Though it's important to note:
- Time-zone can be a difficulty for some job
- Some people are less effective far away from their co-worker
- You can be less stable due to environment changes (e.g.: lacking connection, transportation time, tiredness, ...)
Don't over-estimate yourself, as travelling can be tiring. Seek stability before adventure if you need to be efficient.

- Tips
How to find a place to work
This is definitely a hard task
The important is:
- Find cafe to work (using aggregator of cafe for example)
- Have alternative offline / off electricity (anker battery >>>)
- Hostel, stay safe
// TODO: create an aggregator of place to work


Stay safe: Insurance, sickness, hospital
Wiki-voyage has comprehensive offline documentation for this cases. 
Get treated and vaccinated before going.

If you are in hostel (dormitory kind), and you are on extreme budget, sleeping bag is an alternative, so you know in what you sleep every night.

To wash your clothes:
- Find local washing machine
- Wash them by hand (hard mode if you don't have correct clothe's material)

SIM is a pain to get, but it can unlock phone number which is necessary for some service (e.g.: South Korea)
It has more local provider, compared to ESIM which can rely on off-zone territory (e.g.: Hong Kong), and has less great debit.

There's also local provider giving worldwide available phone service (e.g.: TODO add example)
