Who this presentation is for

A little history about Web (in very quick)

Web1 introduced reading only content, on user machine. They were mostly decentralized

Web2 introduced interactivity and user-generated content

Though you can hardly have a business model from a free software, and paid software are not easily accesible by average population
E.g.: Paying Google Earth, Web indexer, Winrar, ...
Distributing your software for free is very effective for adoption.

But there's a loophole

The market of predicting the future.

An asset manager is a company taking investor's money, giving it to promising company, and getting more money.
This is the base of capitalism.
Money == More Money
But to do good guess, they have to guess the future.
That's where the data-scientist comes.
His job is to take data, find correlation, and predict potential future correlation.
Exemple: Target pregnancy prediction story

Which means Data == Money
They sell your data to this company for money.

Web2 is **broken**
The data driven market is **dangerous**
Why your data is precious?

The problem with hyper-centralization 
The attention economy problem 
-> Hype before quality
-> Time == Money, not Good Service == Money
-> The algoritm issues 

Applications are made to **take the most of your time**, they serve you as a consequence

## What are the other model?

Centralization vs Decentralization (P2P) vs blockchain 

# What is the solution? 

This is a trust chain, you need to determine who you are trusting.
Your best bet are not on GAFAM known to sell your privacy, but on __FOSS alternative__ and ethical company 
They must be audited for security (Yourself or external company)

Can be self-hosted (You need to pay your server) and linked to a P2P network (Example: Matrix, Activity Pub), or hosted on a Blockchain (dApp) (User pay for their transactions + deployment of the package)

/!\ Blockchain use is specific, and meant for resilience and reproductibility. Data are public and must not be confidential (e.g.: DAO, identity verification, ledger, ...). This is not a solution for everything.

Though FOSS alternative development needs to be financed
- State (e.g.: France to get numeric sovereignty (la DINUM), la forge, ...)
- Individual who needs open solution
- Community financed
- Open source oriented organization (Framasoft, Samourai Coop, ...)
- Or volunteered (corejs scandal, logjs, ...)

# Ethical Organization
- Nextcloud
- Proton
- Signal
- ...

Permissionned vs Permissionless

# Example of P2P / Blockchain solution

- Decentralized economy (Bitcoin, Ethereum, ...)
- File sharing - IPFS / Bittorrent
- P2P communication (Berty)
- Smart-contract / DAO culture
- Zero knowledge proof
- Data verification (Proof you took a photo at a certain date)
- Bounty (Though dangerous with autonomous agent if permissionless /!\)
- TOR (Permissionless)
- Governance (DAOs)

# What it solves today

Stable coin in highly corrupted state (venezuela, Zimbabwe, ...)
Whistleblower tools
IPFS wikipedia resilience
Supply chain verification (walmart, pharmaceuticals, automotive)
Prove your age without showing your ID
Remittances — cheaper cross-border transfers vs Western Union
Creator economy — direct payments, no platform cut
Decentralized identity — EU Digital Identity Wallet initiative

## Key Stats
- Walmart supply chain: 7 days → 2.2 seconds to trace contamination
- 1.4 billion unbanked adults worldwide
- Ethereum energy reduction: 99.95% post-merge (Proof of Stake)

# Addressing Criticisms

| Critique | Counter-argument |
|----------|------------------|
| Energy consumption | Proof of Stake uses 99.9% less energy (Ethereum post-merge) |
| Used for crime | Blockchain is traceable; cash is still preferred by criminals |
| Too complex | UX is improving rapidly; like early internet |
| Just speculation | Real production systems exist (see examples above) |

# What went wrong (and why)

- **FTX, Luna/Terra** → Centralized entities pretending to be decentralized
- **NFT bubble** → Speculation ≠ technology value
- **Rug pulls** → Permissionless systems can be exploited
- **Lesson:** Decentralization theater vs actual decentralization

# What you can do (Call to Action)

- Try FOSS alternatives (Signal, Proton, Nextcloud)
- Learn to self-host (simple: Pi-hole, Nextcloud on Raspberry Pi)
- Understand before investing (if ever)
- Build on open protocols if you're a dev
- Question who controls your data
